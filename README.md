# Google-Clone
Welcome to my Google Clone! I have created a fully functional front-end replica of Google using only HTML and CSS. The project includes the standard Google search, image search, and advanced search features, and all search queries are redirected through the actual Google search engine for accurate results.

In addition to its functionality, my Google Clone is designed to be visually appealing and responsive. I have paid close attention to the aesthetic details of the original Google website, creating a seamless and immersive user experience. This clone is also optimized for mobile devices, so users can access it on the go.

Whether you are a web developer looking for a new project or a Google enthusiast looking for an immersive and fully functional front-end clone, my Google Clone has everything you need.
